# React examples

* [A simple counter.](counter.html) This is a basic React example. There is a functional component with the `useState` hook. Notice how the core logic — the `counter` state field — is mixed with the fluff — the fade effects.
* [A counter with separate core logic.](separate_logic.html) Here, the core logic is separate — it is defined as an object that has one command and one query. The fluff widget does not need to know how the core logic works.
